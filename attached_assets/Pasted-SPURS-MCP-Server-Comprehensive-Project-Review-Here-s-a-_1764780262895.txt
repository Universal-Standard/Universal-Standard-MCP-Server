SPURS MCP Server - Comprehensive Project Review
Here's a full rundown of your project's current state and what needs improvement:

Capabilities
Current State:

Multi-AI platform support (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini)
Full MCP protocol implementation (HTTP REST + WebSocket)
Tool, prompt, and resource registry system
API key authentication with scoped permissions
Rate limiting on MCP routes
PostgreSQL database for persistence
Gaps:

No automatic fallback if a provider fails
No health checks to verify AI providers are working
Provider configuration is required before AI features work (no guided setup)
Tools (9 Built-in)
Current State:

Tool	Status	Notes
ai_chat	Functional	Requires configured provider
ai_summarize	Functional	Requires configured provider
ai_providers	Basic	Just lists providers
web_search	Stub	Returns fake/canned results
code_sandbox	Security Risk	Executes arbitrary JavaScript unsafely
generate_uuid	Works	Simple utility
timestamp	Works	Simple utility
json_format	Works	Simple utility
base64	Works	Simple utility
Issues:

web_search doesn't actually search anything
code_sandbox has no real sandboxing - security vulnerability
AI tools require provider keys to be configured first
Process Flow
How it works:

User request → API key validation → Rate limit check → Route handler
Tool execution → Registry lookup → Provider selection → Result
WebSocket supports real-time streaming
Gaps:

WebSocket allows API key in URL query string (not secure)
No per-message authorization on WebSocket
Error handling is basic - no guidance on how to fix issues
Usability
What's Good:

Clean navigation with dedicated pages (Tools, Resources, Playground, etc.)
Tool forms are auto-generated from schemas - no JSON editing needed
Real-time search filtering works well
Demo API key works out of the box
What's Missing:

Connections page is just a placeholder (doesn't work)
Add-ons page is just a placeholder (doesn't work)
No loading states or empty states when things aren't configured
No guided setup flow for new users
UI/UX Design
Strengths:

Modern dark sidebar design
Consistent component styling
Responsive layout
Professional appearance
Weaknesses:

No accessibility features (screen reader labels, keyboard navigation)
Color contrast not verified
Some buttons have visibility issues (white on white)
Connectivity
Working:

PostgreSQL database with all tables (API keys, providers, activity logs, chat history)
WebSocket endpoint for real-time MCP communication
REST API for all operations
Issues:

Provider API keys stored as plain text (not encrypted)
No integration with external key management systems
External integrations page is non-functional
User Experience
Happy Path: Works well - demo key lets you explore tools and try AI playground

Pain Points:

Real AI features require manual key configuration with no guidance
Errors show as toast messages but don't explain how to fix them
Placeholder pages feel incomplete
Enterprise Readiness (Your Intent)
For an "official MCP server for US-SPURS," these enterprise requirements are missing:

Requirement	Status
Secure secret storage	❌ Plain text in DB
Role-based access control	❌ Only API scopes
Audit log export	❌ Not available
SIEM/webhook integration	❌ Not available
Code execution sandboxing	❌ Unsafe
Provider health monitoring	❌ Not available
TLS/HTTPS enforcement	❌ Not documented
Data retention policies	❌ Not configurable
